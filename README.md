# dog-breed-classification-ENEL-645-FINAL-PROJECT-

This project uses VGG16 which is a pretrained image net model to train and categorize 15 breeds of dogs from their images.
This will make it easier for shelter homes to identify and record the data of each rescued dog so that they know how to treat, properly handle and decide which dogs are dangerous or can be adopted as pets.
The dataset used is stanford dog breed dataset from kaggle.
